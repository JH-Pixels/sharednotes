# Consider Not Using An Alarm
For many it will sound odd, but I believe that not relying on an alarm to wake up every Morning can have some great benefits.
## Concept Explained
When going to bed, make sure you are tired. Do not just go to bed because it is your bedtime or any other reason. It is no use laying on the bed while not being able to sleep at all. It is exactly what it feels like... a *waste of time*. 
Instead, you should go to bed when you notice that you are tired for the first (or potentially second) time. This ensures that when you go to bed you actually do go to sleep immediately or at least as fast as possible for you. Do *not* set an alarm. Then just wake up whenever you feel like it. Just make sure you don't spend too much time in bed after waking up, since that will only make you more tired.

## Benefits 
### You Will Almost Never Be Tired Again
It is obviously not always the case but relying on your inner clock and feeling instead of an external clock you will greatly decrease your fatigue. A Clock has no idea how long you stayed awake last night, how tired you are, and how good or bad your sleep was. Obviously there are some devices that can track and tell you that with great accuracy, (e.g. Smartwatches) but they will never be as good, accurate and reliable as your own guts.
### Flexibility
By not having a certain time to go to bed you can be more spontaneous and flexible as before. If you want to stay awake a little longer, and you don't really feel tired, you can just do it. Without having to worry about the fact that the longer you stay awake, the less sleep you will have. 
### Health
It is a lot better for your body. Both physically and mentally. Read more about it [here](https://www.news-medical.net/health/Does-Your-Alarm-Sound-Affect-Your-Mood.aspx#:~:text=Sudden%20sounds%20cause%20higher%20blood,could%20trigger%20our%20stress%20levels.)
## Drawbacks
*It is not for everyone!*
This method will definitely not work for many people. Somebody with a fixed schedule like regular people working a 9 to 5 or if you are still in school or university will not always be able to wake up when they need to.
The effectiveness of this method also greatly depends on the person. Someone who has the option to wake up whenever they want to might find it better for themselves to have a fixed schedule and routine. 

## Personal Experience
I am in the great position not to have a fixed schedule and being able to use this method and it's benefits for myself. Since I have implemented it (about 3 months ago) I noticeably sleep *a lot* better. I used to reset the alarm to 5 or 10 more minutes after initially waking up because I was just too tired to wake up immediately. I knew that I could not wake up at the very moment without being tired for the entire rest of the day. What I did not know was that having these 5 to 10 minutes sleep cycles after already having woken up actually makes me more tired during the day. For me, a great time to go to the bed is between *10:30 pm* and *11:30 pm*. Then I would wake up at about 8 am.
Honestly, to everyone who had the freedom to be able and allowed to do this method I really recommend it. If you are still in doubt, you might want to try it out for 3â€“4 days. Maybe it is for you, maybe it is not. But either way, it is absolutely worth trying.
